Many scientists use R for data wrangling, visualization, and statistical tests.
Often, we keep analyses as scripts so we can replay every step months or years later—great for reproducibility.
But collaborators who don’t code frequently rely on GUI tools, sometimes commercial.
That gap means not everyone can reproduce results, and the exact sequence of steps soon becomes unclear.

We solved this problem by developing a Shiny app called OpenStats (https://github.com/ComPlat/OpenStats).
For a detailed description of the app and its usage, please see our preprint:

## What is OpenStats

OpenStats is an R package that launches a Shiny app for common statistical workflows.
It’s designed for non-programmers to analyze data with confidence.

Supported features:

- Data wrangling
- Visualization
- Creating statistical models (lm and glm)
- Test assumptions
- Run tests (t-test, ANOVA, PostHoc tests, etc.)
- Dose Response analysis

## History replay

The striking feature of *OpenStats* is that it stores each successful user action in the *history*.
Alongside the results, the *history* is shown in human-readable form. Thereby, users can retrace each step.
Moreover, the *history* is stored as JSON, which can be used to replay the entire analysis.
Thus, users have a wide range of methods plus the replay capabilities of a script.
